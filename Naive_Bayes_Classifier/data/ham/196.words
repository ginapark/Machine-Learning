The
RE
in
the
subjuec
headers
is
redundant
Also
it
confuses
some
of
the
email
filters
Please
leave
out
the
RE
Thanks

On
the
contrary
I
have
numerous
email
come
in
and
therefore
cannot
take
the
time
to
read
the
all
This
helps
me
to
quickly
determine
if
it
is
a
new
subject
to
address
or
not
