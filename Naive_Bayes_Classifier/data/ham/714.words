Hi
every
body
I
need
help
guys
So
far
in
my
life
I
havent
done
any
thing
like
this
but
I
like
to
learn
Is
there
an
idiots
guide
for
a
beginner
to
start
programming
a
handy
board
Can
some
body
tell
me
where
to
buy
a
handy
board
and
which
version
is
the
best
for
me
Thanks
anton
