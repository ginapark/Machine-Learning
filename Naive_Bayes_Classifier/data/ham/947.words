I
have
been
making
my

PCBs
and
would
like
to
coat
the
copper
side
with
something
to
keep
the
copper
in
good
shape
does
anyone
have
any
suggestions
Hi
Clancy
there
are
tinning
compounds
for
use
prior
to
soldering
but
Ive
always
just
sprayed
it
with
clear
lacquer
after
soldering
Keeps
the
copper
from
oxidizing
Cheers
Duncan
