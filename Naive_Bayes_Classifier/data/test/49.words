the

a
good
source

The
Gamma
Velids

of
the
Dutch
Meteor
Society

The

The
radiant
lies

The

is
currently
located
at

which
places
it
in
central
Coma
Berenicids
ten
degrees
northeast
of
the
second

star
Denebola
Beta

This
radiant
is
best
placed
for
viewing
just
before
dawn
when
it
lies
highest
above
the
horizon
At
65

the
Coma
Berenicids
produce
mostly
swift
meteors
with
the
brighter
shower
members

The
Quadrantids

activity
on

This
corresponds
to

hours
The
western
Pacific
area
is
favored
for
the
2006
display
but
on
the
morning
of
January
4
local
time
The
radiant
is
located
at
1520
230

This
position
lies
in
a
sparse
area
of
northern
Bootes
ten
degrees
south
of
the
third
magnitude
star
Iota

Rates
can
exceed
one
hundred
shower

per
hour
if
the
radiant
is
high
in
a
dark
sky
at
the
time
of
maximum
activity
Most
observers
will
see
much
less
than
this
probably
closer
to
25
per
hour
While
some
activity
may
be
seen
during
the
evening
hours
from
high
northern
latitude
areas
the
prime
hours
lie
in
the
late
morning
hours
when
the
radiant
rises
high
into
the
northeastern
sky
This
shower
is
not
well
seen
south
of
the
equator
as
the
radiant
does
not
rise
sufficiently
high
into
the
sky
before
the
start
of
morning
twilight
At

the
Quadrantids

The
Sporadic
rates
for
the
Northern
Hemisphere
are
now
just
past
their
annual
peak
One
would
expect
to
see
perhaps
eight
random
meteors
per
hour
during
the
last
hours
before
dawn
from
rural
observing
sites
During
the
evening
hours
perhaps
three
random
meteors
can
be
seen
per
hour
Sporadic
rates
seen
from
the
Southern
Hemisphere
are
increasing
toward
a
peak
this
month
One
would
see
approximately
six
random
meteors
per
hour
during
the
late
morning
hours
and
two
per
hour
during
the
evening
Possible

Observers
in
South
America
should
be
on
the
alert
near
0620
Universal
Time
on
January
2
when
the
Earth
is
predicted
to
pass
through
a
trail
of
debris
produced
by
C1969T
TagoSatoKosaka
The
predicted
radiant
lies
at
1524
231
57
This
position
lies
near
the
borders
of
the
constellations
of
Norma
Circinus
and
Lupus
five
degrees
southeast
of
the
third
magnitude
star
Zeta
Lupi
It
is
impossible
to
predict
the
exact
intensity
of
this
display
or
even
if
it
will
occur
The
circumstances
are
unusually
favorable
though
as
the
Earth
passes
only
26000
miles
from
the
predicted
center
of
this
debris
Now
the
question
is
just
how
richly
populated
is
this
trail
with
the
comet
now
37
years
past
perihelion
