Hello
everyone
DMDX
is
reporting
errors
in
the
azk
file
In
particular
a
frame
that
contains
an
asterisk
before
the
presentation
of
an
item
in
a
masked
priming
experiment
is
systematically
delayed
after
a
response
timeout
or
a
response
time
that
is
close
to
the
timeout
It
doesnt
bother
me
much
or
at
all
because
there
are
never
errors
in
the
amount
of
time
the
prime
and
the
target
stay
on
the
screen
I
was
just
wondering
if
it
is
normal
and
about
how
I
could
solve
it
Thank
you
Joo
