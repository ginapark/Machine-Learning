The
breakdown
occurs
purely
from
the
dielectric
material
Remember
lightning
You
dont
all
of
a
sudden
see
the
clouds
come
crashing
down
to
the
ground
and
then
have
a
discharge

Kind
of
Electrolytics
are
indeed
made
by
plates
in
a
conductive
solution
however
when
the
voltage
increases
it
pulls
the
plates
together
standard
columbs
law
stuff
When
you
exceed
the
rated
voltage
the
force
on
the
plates
is
enough
to
pull
the
plate
through
the
dielectric
and
to
make
contact
The
turns
the
capacitor
into
a
wire
and
if
current
continues
to
flow
into
a
small
explosive
device
If
it
is
oil
filled
not
as
common
these
days
you
get
a
smokey
orange
fire
ball
very
impressive
but
scary
as
hell
the
first
time
