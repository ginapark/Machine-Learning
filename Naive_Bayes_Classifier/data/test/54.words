can
do
it
Im
curious
how
the
users
of
your
system
would
be
motivated
to
crash
it
If
youre
simply
looking
for
a
safe
development
environment
consider
a
version
of
BASIC
without
poke

Hello
all
im
trying
to
write
a
small
OS
but
am
confused
about
something
I
dont
want
to
give
access
to
all
memory
locations
for
the
user
only
for
the
supervisor
Since
the
68hc11
doenst
have
these
modes
i
have
to
think
of
something
else
A
sollution
is
a
external
mmu
but
this
maybe
some
overkill
Does
anyone
have
some
suggestions
or
is
it
simply
impossible
to
do
