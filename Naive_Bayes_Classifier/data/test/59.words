A

30
sequential
timeouts
Mind
you
that
value
of
30
what
chosen
eons
ago
in
the
days
before
a
high
performance
counter
when
we
were
lucky
to
know
the
retrace
interval
to
within
a
tenth
of
a
millisecond
Given
that
every
machine
has
one
these
days
and
we
could
assume
that
interval
is
known
to
within
microseconds
I
could
happily
increase
its
value
to
300
and
thered
be
no
loss
of
functionality
It
of
course
puts
the
onus
on
users
to
get
the
value
of
the
retrace
accurate
which
is
why
its
left
at
the
value
of
30
And
yes
a
machine
with
certain
errors
isnt
good
Once
DMDX
hits
a
certain
error
condition
it
just
goes
into
a
tight
loop
polling
for
the
retrace
indicator
till
it
actually
finds
a
retrace
and
then
reschedules
everything
accordingly
You
can
see
it
in
the
AZK
file
as
it
will
flag
the
error
if
it
occurs
during
the
presentation
of
a
stimulus
So
you
could
build
an
item
file
and
either
run
it
yourself
or
make
one
thats
amenable
to
Diagnostic
mode
and
see
just
how
often
the
errors
occur
in
a
tachistoscopic
frame
My
guess
is
that
its
rarely
If
its
actually
a
problem
I
can
either
make
the
number
of
timeouts
till
a
certain
error
is
thrown
greater
or
make
it
under
user
control
my
guess
is
that
Id
make
a
registry
key
with
the
value
in
it
and
let
you
use
RegEdit
to
modify
it
because
this
is
literally
the
first
time
its
been
a
concern
