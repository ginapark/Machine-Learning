We
cant
have
run
slots
named
after
the
model
that
is
running
in
them
anymore
because
then
all
those
slots
would
be
WRF
Therefore
we
have
chosen
to
rename
the
Eta
slots
to
eliminate
the
association
with
a
particular
model
Speaking
of
the
replacement
of
Eta
now
NAM
by
WRFNMM
we
had
been
planning
on
doing
that
in
late
September
2005
We
have
now
targeted
that
replacement
to
occur
in
late
March
2006
This
difficult
decision
was
made
as
a
result
of
three
factors
a
delayed
delivery
acceptance
of
NCEPs
new
computer
upgrade
which
has
caused
a
backlog
of
implementations
to
build
up
b
new
and
still
evolving
consequences
of
the
recent
decision
to
put
50
of
our
computer
system
at
the
Fairmont
WV
site
and
c
the
complex
and
intricate
nature
of
the
new
WRF
system
which
has
added
to
our
planned
development
