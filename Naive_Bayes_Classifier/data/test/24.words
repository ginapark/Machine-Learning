danger
in
Zimbabwe
This
land
problem
came
when
Zimbabwean
President
Mr
Robert
Mugabe
introduce
a
new
land
Act
Reform
wholly
affecting
the
rich
white
farmers
and
some
few
black
farmers
and
this
resulted
to
the
killing
and
mob
action
by
Zimbabwean
war
veterans
and
some
lunatics
in
the
society
In
fact
a
lot
of
people
were
killed
because
of
this
land
reform
Act
for
which
my
father
was
one
of
the
victims
It
is
against
this
background
that
I
and
my
family
fled
Zimbabwe
for
fear
of
our
lives
and
are
currently
staying
in
Holland
where
we
are
seeking
political
asylum
and
more
so
have
decided
to
transfer
my
fathers
money
to
a
more
reliable
foreign
account
Since
the
law
of
Holland
prohibits
a
refugee
asylum
seeker
to
open
any
bank
account
or
to
be
involve
in
any
financial
transaction
As
the
eldest
son
of
my
father
I
am
saddled
with
the
responsibility
of
seeking
a
genuine
foreign
partneraccount
where
this
money
could
be
transferred
without
the
knowledge
of
my
government
who
are
bent
on
taking
everything
we
have
acquired
Sir
Madam
If
you
are
willing
to
undertake
this
with
me
I
am
willing
to
give
you

of
the
fund
for
your
assistance
and
I
have
also
mapped
out
5
to
cover
any
expenses
incurred
from
the
transaction
Also
be
aware
the
balance
amount
will
be
set
aside
for
the
investment
through
you
and
the
profit
from
the
investment
will
be
share
50
each
for
you
and
my
family
after
expenses
