I
have
the
following
message
DirectX
reports

Flipping
The
video
card
in
this
machine
is
not
adequate
for
DMDXs
purpose
I
guess
this
means
I
must
change
the
video
card
but
I
have
hope
there
is
a
solution
as
the
previous
versions
of
DMDX
worked
well
with
this
video
card
Yeah
thats
pretty
odd
Even
if
you
were
using
an
exceedingly
ancient
version
of
DMDX
beforehand
its
still
odd
Its
possible
to
have
multiple
instances
of
DMDX
and
or
TimeDX
alive
at
the
same
time
which
can
produce
that
kind
of
error
in
which
case
rebooting
will
fix
it
Otherwise
Id
try
updating
video
drivers
and
the
usual
sorts
of
tricks
like
deleting
hardware
to
see
if
something
else
hasnt
clagged
the
machine
