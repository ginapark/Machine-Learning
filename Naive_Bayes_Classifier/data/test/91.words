Does
anybody
out
ther
have
RF
wirless
video
on
there
BOT
I
want
to
construct
a
wirless
video
transmitter
that
will
send
a
signal
to
a
near
by
monitor
or
computer
but
not
the
high
powered
ones
that
require
a
FCC
license
any
suggestions
would
be
helpful
I
seem
to
recall
seeing
serveral
kits
that
werent
too
expensive
both
online
and
at
the
neighborhood
electronics
parts
store
This
would
commonly
be
used
to
transmit
video
from
a
single
VCR
or
cable
box
to
any
TV
in
your
house
