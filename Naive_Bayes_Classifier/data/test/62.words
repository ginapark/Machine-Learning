HI
I
just
have
a
few
questions
for
the
experts
approximately
how
many
lines
of
code
can
the
handyboards
memory
hold
I
want
to
know
so
I
have
a
scope
of
how
big
a
program
can
be
written
to
it
Also
I
read
in
the
mobile
robotics
book
that
it
is
possible
to
interface
another
32k
memory
chip
using
existing
lines
and
an
inverter
on
the
CE
line
is
this
possible
on
the
handyboard
and
if
it
is
would
it
be
a
good
idea
Thank
you
in
advance
