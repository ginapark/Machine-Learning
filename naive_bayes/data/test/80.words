hi
from
France
I
already
have
a
handyboard
running
with
a
11A1
chip
and
I
plan
to
adapt
the
circuit
for
a
11F1
chip
with
the
same
memory
map
Does
someone
have
any
experience
about
running
IC
with
this
chip
Will
it
work
with
the
pcodehbs19
file
and
standard
downloaders
DL
or
DLM
Thanks
for
any
help
