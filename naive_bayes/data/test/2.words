Hello
everyone
I
am
wondering
if
anybody
have
done
something
like
a
sensor
that
can
detect
a
tennis
ball
probably
10
15
cm
away
If
someone
have
done
this
one
kindly
sent
some
information
I
am
trying
to
build
a
multirobot
where
one
should
get
the
tennis
ball
and
pass
it
to
the
other
who
will
dump
the
ball
to
some
prespecified
place
I
already
finished
with
the
DUMPER
thing
but
I
am
still
looking
for
a
sensor
that
can
locate
the
tennis
ball
not
the
vision
sensor
its
a
bit
expensive
Thanks
in
advance
and
am
looking
forward
on
it
