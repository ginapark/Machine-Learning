That
did
answer
my
question
I
am
not
familiar
with
servo
motors
I
have
only
used
plain
DC
motors
I
am
also
familiar
with
PWM
I
was
just
unable
to
determine
if
the
same
PWM
signal
that
drives
plain
DC
motors
could
also
drive
servo
motors
From
what
I
understand
a
servo
motor
and
DC
motor
use
PWM
to
control
the
speed
and
if
that
is
the
case
I
did
not
see
the
difference
in
using
the
same
PWM
signal
that
drives
a
DC
motor
to
also
drive
a
servo
motor
Thank
you
for
all
of
your
help
If
I
stated
anything
incorrectly
in
this
paragraph
please
correct
me
