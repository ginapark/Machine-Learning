I
assembled
the
Serial
Line
and
Stop
Switch
44
if
youre
following
the
online
assembly
instructions
on
the
mit
site
The
first
part
of
the
testing
442
went
well
The
BATT
LED
cycles
on
and
then
off
The
PWR
LED
turns
off
when
the
BATT
LED
turns
off
I
connected
the
main
board
to
IC
board
through
the
phone
cable
The
HB
goes
into
bootstrap
mode
I
turned
it
on
while
holding
down
the
STOP
switch
The
PWR
BATT
LEDs
came
on
for
a
moment
and
both
turned
off
Tried
downloading
pcodehbs19
using
hdbl
but
got
an
error
Typed
dl
pcodehbs19
but
it
timed
out
on
serial
receive
mentioned
256
bytes
remaining
IC
tells
me
it
cannot
sync
with
the
boardPlease
press
the
reset
button
Heres
what
I
do
know
The
cable
Im
using
has
the
2
and
3
pins
switched
as
required
and
grounds
connected
Its
on
COM1
of
my
pc
so
no
com
problems
When
I
run
dl
pcodehbs19
ignoreinput
the
program
will
go
through
and
ignore
all
the
serial
echoes
and
so
on
and
load
into
the
HB
I
believe
this
is
true
because
when
I
then
reset
the
HB
the
piezo
beeper
beeps
at
me
I
went
ahead
and
installed
that
as
well
as
it
said
it
would
So
basically
sending
to
the
HB
works
but
getting
anything
transmitted
from
the
HB
does
not
happen
I
believe
this
is
true
because
the
lights
on
both
boards
will
blink
as
the
program
is
loading
into
the
HB
but
they
do
nothing
when
the
downloaders
ask
the
HB
to
send
something
back
Has
anyone
run
into
this
problem
Could
it
be
a
faulty
MAX232
on
the
ic
board
not
letting
communications
through
Thanks
for
your
help
