straight
to
the
part
of
the
circuit
which
requires
that
voltage
and
that
works
fine
I
then
take
the
96v
to
an
LM350
regulator
adjusted
to
5v
DC
which
is
supposed
to
be
capable
of
delivering
3A
The
regulator
seems
to
be
working
fine
when
it
is
checked
with
a
multimeter
but
when
I
attempt
to
operate
the
circuit
which
should
and
seems
to
only
want
to
draw
about
400mA
it
fails
to
work
The
same
circuit
works
reliably
when
connected
in
the
manner
illustrated
below
to
both
the
96v
battery
and
a
regulated
5v
DCon
the
HB
supply
which
is
in
turn
connected
through
a
12v
1A
DC
supply
connected
to
the
240v
mains

The
negative

of
both
supplies
are
not
in
any
way
connected
within
the
circuit
but
the
connection
between
the
positive
terminals
seems
to
be
essential
I
have
discovered
this
method
of
powering
my
project
quite
by
accident
and
am
interested
in
any
methods
for
obtaining
both
the
5v
supply
and
the
6514v
supply
from
a
battery
as
that
is
what
will
be
required
