Presently
Im
constructing
a
mobile
robot
to
move
within
a
battle
field
of
5metres
by
5metres
In
side
the
battle
filed
the
mines
are
visible
with
diameter
300mm
It
has
a
white
reflector
tape
surround
it
at
the
circumstance
on
the
bottom
of
the
mines
he
mines
are
placed
ramdomly
in
the
battle
fieldThe
robot
CANNOT
bump
into
it
The
robot
has
to
avoid
from
begining
till
the
end
The
robot
has
to
cross
from
one
end
to
the
opposite
end
as
fast
as
possible
Im
using
2
stepper
motors
to
drive
the
robot
Pls
take
note
there
is
another
condition
Besides
the
mines
there
are
obstacles
totally
in
black
eg
pails
around
The
robot
can
bump
into
the
obstacle
but
has
to
move
away
and
then
search
the
finish
end
I
will
be
using
10
retroreflective
sensors
photoelectric
The
working
Sensing
range
is
50mm
away
from
the
mines
When
the
robot
sense
the
mines
at
50mm
away
it
has
to
avoid
and
turn
left
or
right
and
then
forward
again
Pls
help
me
to
solve
the
alogorithm
when
the
robot
move
till
one
location
the
robot
will
know
where
it
is
within
the
5m
by
5m
