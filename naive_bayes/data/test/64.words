After
driving
all
my
robots
with
step
motors
I
finally
decided
to
try
driving
one
with
DC
motors
I
got
a
couple
of
the
lego
gearmotors
and
mounted
them
on
my
robot
with
belts
driving
the
wheels
at
a
reduction
ratio
of
about
151
and
have
been
doing
some
experimenting
with
the
different
speeds
I
am
very
surprised
at
the
lack
of
change
between
speed
11
which
is
the
slowest
speed
that
will
actually
make
the
motor
turn
and
speed
100
As
near
as
I
can
tell
there
is
an
18
rpm
difference
between
speed
11
and
speed
100
The
difference
is
so
small
that
I
cant
see
any
difference
when
I
run
my
robot
across
the
floor
at
any
speed
given
that
speed
11
results
in
183
rpm
at
the
wheel
that
is
less
than
a
1
change
Has
this
been
the
case
with
any
of
you
Am
I
doing
something
wrong
I
dont
want
to
have
to
go
back
to
step
motors
Please
email
me
with
your
experiences
Note
I
am
using
IC
32
but
I
dont
know
if
the
new
smooth
pwm
routines
are
in
there
Anybody
know
how
I
can
tell
and
if
theyre
not
how
do
I
implement
them
thanks
for
any
insight
you
can
give
me
