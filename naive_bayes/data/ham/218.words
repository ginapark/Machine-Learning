Hello
All
My
handy
board
will
not
communicate
with
the
host
computer
When
I
connect
the
phone
cable
the
charge
led14
lights
bright
and
resistor
r11
gets
real
hot
I
have
a
v2x
compass
on
the
robot
and
program
already
loaded
and
it
works
ok
Any
help
would
be
appreciated
Thanks
in
advance
Terry
