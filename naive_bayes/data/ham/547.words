deregulation
breaks
down
electronic
walls
At
one
point
the
debate
veered
off
on
abortion
Seeing
a
hightech
gag
rule
Rep
Nita
Lowey
DNY
joined
by
Pat
Schroeder
DColo
and
several
other
women
lawmakers
asserted
the
antipornography
provisions
would
outlaw
discussions
about
abortion
over
the
Internet
the
global
computer
network
Rep
Henry
Hyde
RIll
a
leading
abortion
foe
assured
members
that
nothing
in
the
bill
suggested
any
restrictions
on
discussions
about
abortion
Well
Henry
Hyde
was
right
nothing
in
the
bill
suggests
restrictions
on
abortion
discussion
the
restrictions
are
in
Title
18
of
the
US
Code
which
now
includes
computer
networks
