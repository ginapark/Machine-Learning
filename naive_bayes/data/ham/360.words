included
in
his
Amateur

column
a
short
description
of
a
new
Printed
Circuit
Fabrication
material
where
you
ran
the
copper
clad
through
a
laser
printer
to
print
directly
onto
the
copper
rather
than
using
iron
on
transfer
sheets
I
saw
an
article
about
the
process
you
described
in
the
November
1997
issue
of
Electronics
