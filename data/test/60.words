Hi
Jonathan
In
fact
I
have
run
TimeDX
but
still
fail
to
run
DMDX
Some
time
before
I
installed
DMDX
on
IBM
thinkpad
570
laptop
with
DirectX81
it
works
properly
I
am
not
sure
if
it
is
the
DirectX
that
lead
to
the
failure
of
running
the
DMDX
on
my
IBM
thinkpad
T40with
DirectX90
Shouldnt
be
any
problem
as
all
XP
machines
are
DX
9
and
it
works
on
them
In
fact
we
hardly
have
any
machines
that
arent
DX
9
Perhaps
if
you
can
actually
tell
me
what
the
error
message
is
I
can
give
better
directions
