Hi
I
intend
to
use
a
5V
source
battery
going
thru
a
DC
to
DC
converter
to
get
a
12V
source
Then
this
12v
will
connect
to
my
diffuse
sensor
which
operrate
at
12V
The
sensors
current
consumption
maximum
is
35mA
If
the
output
Watt
of
the
DCDC
convertor
at
the
12v
source
is
1W
can
I
said
that
the
the
current
is
112
83mA
PVI
If
the
current
supply
to
the
sensor
is
83mA
and
the
sensor
co
nsumption
is
max
35mA
will
it
damaged
my
sensor
Or
should
I
use
less
than
35mA
My
battery
source
is
5V13Ah
before
going
thru
the
convertor
