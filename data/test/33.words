there
is
a
menu
which
contains
all
previous
tests
performed
In
order
to
simplify
the
managment
avoid
mistake
I
want
just
to
have
there
the
tests
to
be
performed
and
remove
the
others
Is
there
a
way
to
cleaning
up
this
menu
Sure
find
yourself
a
registry
modifier
and
delete
the
subkeys
of
HKEYLOCALMACHINESOFTWAREDMDX2LastUsedItemFile
youll
want
to
leave
the
default
value
of
the
key
alone
If
you
are
open
to
bartering
I
can
write
such
a
utility
for
you
If
you
only
want
to
do
it
once
you
can
do
it
by
hand
easily
enough
with
REGEDITEXE
in
your
WINDOWS
directory
