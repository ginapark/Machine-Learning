how
to
connect
the
Hamamatsu
P5587
to
the
Handy
Boardwith
an
expansion
Schematic
or
pinsout
would
be
great
If
your
sensor
output
port
already
taken
is
there
any
other
port
on
the
handy
board
we
can
use
to
connect
the
Hamamatsu
P5587
What
test
routine
do
we
have
to
use
Any

would
be
really
appriciated
Thanks
