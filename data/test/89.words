if
Ms
X
at
SUNY
or
Ms
Y
at
UCSC
or
Dr
Westall
at
Clemson
inadvertently
sends
their
canned
responses
to
cslistfudanedu
rather
than
gyqinfundanedu
then
their
reply
is
reflected
back
to
everybody
on
the
original
list
and
to
make
matters
worse
Mr
Gao
never
sees
it
and
so
he
may
try
again
I
dont
think
we
will
EVER
stop
this
Chinese
spam
and
so
it
would
appear
that
any
of
us
who
respond
should
be
REALLY
careful
not
to
respond
to
what
looks
like
a
list
