One
begins
to
wonder
why
I
can
not
go
aboard
open
an
account
and
have
the
money
transferred
there
all
by
myself
as
this
of
course
could
have
assured
utmost
confidentiality
of
the
transaction
I
can
not
because
I
am
Civil
Servant
and
the
laws
of
the
Federal
Republic
of
Nigeria
forbids
any
serving
Civil
Servant
maintaining
foreign
accounts
Secondly
I
can
not
resign
my
appointment
in
order
to
handle
this
transaction
as
an
independent
businessman
because
I
can
not
monitor
this
transfer
effectively
from
outside
my
office
Thirdly
the
fund
in
question
has
been
embarked
A
Contractors
Payment
therefore
the
supposed
foreign
contractor
must
be
presented
before
the
fund
can
be
legally
paid
Fourthly
my
contacting
you
is
born
out
of
the
fact
that
I
need
a
foreign
companyperson
with
a
strong
capital
base
to
hold
this
huge
amount
US3500000000
in
trust
otherwise
eye
brows
could
be
raised
if
it
is
paid
into
a
lesser
account
In
transferring
this
money
into
your
account
it
is
my
considered
opinion
that
you
get
30
of
the
total
sum
10
shall
be
set
aside
to
take
care
of
all
expenses
and
60
shall
be
kept
in
your
account
till
I
come
over
to
your
country
to
invest
it
with
your
guidance
For
a
smooth
sail
of
this
transaction
a
masterpiece
plan
has
been
put
in
place
to
the
effect
that
the
whole
operation
will
take
twentyone
working
days
to
drive
it
to
a
successful
or
logical
conclusion
I
mean
to
remit
the
fund
into
your
nominated
account
A
contract
number
from
a
contract
that
has
been
concluded
and
the
contractor
paid
in
full
has
been
reasign
to
this
fund
which
means
that
we
now
have
an
authentic
contract
number
to
work
with
Every
paperfile
in
connection
with
this
transaction
shall
be
carefully
withdrawn
from
all
offices
concerned
after
the
money
must
have
been
safely
remitted
into
your
account
thus
leaving
no
trace
of
the
fund
However
you
should
treat
this
business
with
utmost
confidentiality
as
I
and
my
father
do
not
want
anything
to
jeopardise
our
position
in
the
office
If
you
are
interested
in
this
transaction
I
expect
you
to
contact
me
through
my
Email
address
to
enable
me
instruct
you
on
what

do
as
well
as
furnish
you
with
further
details

I
needed
