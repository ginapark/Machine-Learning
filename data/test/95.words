Hi
I
am
working
on
an
experiment
where
we
are
using
dmdx
to
present
stimuli
IAPS
IADS
and
simultaneously
collecting
psychophysiological
data
with
biopac
hardware
and
acknowledge
software
We
created
a
digital
marker
channel
so
that
we
could
record
the
onset
of
picture
and
sound
presentation
in
acqknowledge
The
dmdx
code
that
we
are
using
is
o
253
to
turn
the
marker
on
and
o
255
to
turn
the
marker
off
The
on
code
precedes
the
picture
and
the
off
code
follows
it
within
the
same
frame
The
marker
is
working
however
there
is
a
delay
approx
57
seconds
from
when
the
stimulus
is
presented
and
the
marker
appears
Does
anyone
have
any
suggestions
for
how
I
might
rectify
this
problem
Thanks
in
advance
Michelle
