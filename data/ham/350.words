I
purchased
two
Sharp
GP2D02
infrared
sensors
from
Acroname
and
downloaded
their
interface
to
a
Handy
Board
and
Barry
Brouilettes
interface
to
the
Handy
Board
I
was
wondering
which
any
of
you
have
used
and
why
so
I
can
select
one
to
use
on
in
my
project
I
am
using
the
expansion
board
and
am
also
wondering
which
ports
you
are
plugging
the
GP2D02s
into
Thanks
