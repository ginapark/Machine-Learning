Howdy
Ive
just
acquired
a
MC68HC711E9CFN2
Motorola
part
and
a
TMP68C711E9T
Toshiba
part
and
I
was
wondering
if
these
will
work
in
the
HandyBoard
They
are
OTP
parts
which
have
already
been
programmed
but
supposedly
will
work
fine
in
expanded
mode
Does
anyone
know
for
sure
Thanks

Ill
give
up
my
modem
when
they
pry
it
from
my
cold
dead
fingers
