I
was
conversing
with
one
the
game
developers
about
TFT
displays
and
he
didnt
recommend
them
for
gaming
as
they
had
50ms
of
so
persistency
So
if
people
are
using
them
and
they
care
about
display
durations
to
with
50ms
periods
they
might
just
want
to
get
some
sensitive
test
equipment
and
bench
their
setup
